# [cvxbook_additional_exercises](https://tschm.github.io/cvxbook_additional_exercises/)

This repo contains additional exercises and data files in Python, Julia, and Matlab for Stanford [EE364a, 
Convex Optimization](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee364a/), that do not appear in the book 
[Convex Optimization](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/).

It is updated after each quarter the course is taught, so the exercise numbers can change.

Instructors can request the solutions by emailing the authors.  Please
include a link to your course.
